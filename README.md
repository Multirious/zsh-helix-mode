# zsh-helix-mode
A WIP Helix keybinding for Z Shell.

Bring comfort of working with Helix keybindings to your Zsh environment.

This plugin attempts to implement Helix keybindings as accurate and complete
as much as possible.
Any existing keybindings that *should* reflect the official default Helix keybinds but doesn't are considered bugs.

**Features**
- Accurate Helix replication! No more switching muscle memory.
- Helix's selection manipulation and movement.
- Match, Goto, Insert, Append, Change, Delete, Replace.
- Multi-cursor, Registers, Shell Pipe, Command mode!
- Yank-Paste for both registers and clipboard!
- Undo-Redo! And with selection history like Helix's.
- Multi-line mode. It's Helix editor right in your prompt!
- Cursor styling. Display different modes with different cursor looks.

  inputs = {
    zsh-helix-mode.url = "github:multirious/zsh-helix-mode/main"
  };
}
```

## Configurations

### Styling

You can change the cursor color and shape for each mode via these environment variables.
The content of these variables should be a string of terminal escape sequences that modify the looks of your terminal cursor.
These are printed everytime after mode changes.


`ZHM_CURSOR_NORMAL`
- Prints the variable whenever the mode changes to normal mode.
- By default, it is `\e[0m\e[2 q\e]12;#B4BEFE\a` which is a string of ANSI escape sequences<br/>
that basically means "reset, block cursor, pastel blue".

`ZHM_CURSOR_SELECT`
- Prints the variable whenever the mode changes to select mode.
- By default, it is `\e[0m\e[2 q\e]12;#F2CDCD\a` which is a string of ANSI escape sequences<br/>
that basically means "reset, block cursor, pastel red".

`ZHM_CURSOR_INSERT`
- Prints the variable whenever the mode changes to insert mode.
- By default, it is `\e[0m\e[5 q\e]12;white\a` which is a string of ANSI escape sequences<br/>
that basically means "reset, vertical blinking cursor, white".

### Clipboard

`ZHM_CLIPBOARD_PIPE_CONTENT_TO`
- System yanked content will be piped to the command in this variable.
- By default, it is `xclip -sel clip` if the `DISPLAY` environment variable is found,<br/>
or `wl-copy` if the `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` environment variable is found,<br/>
otherwise it is empty.


`ZHM_CLIPBOARD_READ_CONTENT_FROM`
- System paste will use the stdout output from the command in this variable.
- By default, it is `xclip -o -sel clip` if the `DISPLAY` environment variable is found,<br/>
or `wl-paste --no-newline` if the `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` environment variable is found,<br/>
otherwise it is empty.

### Compatibility

#### [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions?tab=readme-ov-file#widget-mapping)
For `zsh-autosuggestions` to work with `zsh-helix-mode` you must configure `zsh-autosuggestions`
to use widgets implemented by this plugin:
```zsh
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS+=(
  zhm_history_prev
  zhm_history_next
  zhm_prompt_accept
  zhm_accept
  zhm_accept_or_insert_newline
)
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS+=(
  zhm_move_right
)
ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_PARTIAL_ACCEPT_WIDGETS+=(
  zhm_move_next_word_start
  zhm_move_next_word_end
)
```
More details [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions?tab=readme-ov-file#widget-mapping).

This still have some issues and that is partial accepting using `zhm_move_next_word_start` or `zhm_move_next_word_end`
will leave one last character unaccepted which some can considered them undesirable/annoying (I know I am).
Please submit an issue/PR if you have a solution!

#### [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
Due to how `zsh-syntax-highlighting` works,
[you must source the plugin after `zsh-helix-mode`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting?tab=readme-ov-file#why-must-zsh-syntax-highlightingzsh-be-sourced-at-the-end-of-the-zshrc-file).

`zsh-syntax-highlighting` can override `zsh-helix-mode`'s highlighting. To
mitigate the issue, please add the following after you've sourced `zsh-syntax-highlighting`:
```zsh
# source zsh-helix-mode

# source zsh-syntax-highlighting

zhm-add-update-region-highlight-hook
```

# Plugin Specifics
This section document some features that is different to Helix.

Press `Alt-Enter` in any mode for toggling multi-line mode.
Press `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` in any mode for moving in the command history.

The register `%` will returns the output of the `pwd` command. Originally, it is "current file path" in Helix.

By pressing `Alt-Enter`, the editor will be switched to multi-line mode.
In this mode, a message `-- MULTILINE --` with a newline is prepended to your
commandline to ensure your first line in the buffer is at the same level
to any other lines. Pressing `Enter` key in insert mode will add a newline
at your cursor instead of accepting the command. However, pressing `Enter`
key in normal mode is the same; it will accepts the current command as usual.
Other keys will behave the same.
